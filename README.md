## Scrape Datacamp project page
Every time I finished a [DataCamp project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects) I added it to my [DataCamp_projects repo](https://github.com/mrbarkis/DataCamp_projects). Unfortunately, I forgot to add descriptions and keywords. Luckily, I can now put DataCamp's teachings to use and scrape the descriptions from the DataCamp projects page. By scraping the notebooks themselves, we can also find usefull keywords for each project.
